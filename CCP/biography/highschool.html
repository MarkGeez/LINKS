    <h2><u>Teenage Years</u></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in my teenage years, we moved from Caloocan to Sampaloc, Manila.<sup>1</sup> I attended <abbr title="E. Rodriguez Jr. High School">ERJHS</abbr> from seventh to twelfth grade, where I met many new people.<sup>2</sup> 
      The school was a big part of my life during this time, and it’s where I made some of my best memories.<sup>3</sup> In ninth grade, the pandemic hit, and everything changed.<sup>4</sup> 
      The world went into lockdown, and like many others, I was stuck at home.<sup>5</sup> At first, I lived at my aunt’s house near SM North, unable to leave for months.<sup>6</sup> It was a strange time, and I missed seeing my friends and classmates.<sup>7</sup> 
      When the lockdown was finally lifted after six months, my father came to pick me up, and we returned to our home in Sampaloc.<sup>8</sup> The pandemic brought its challenges, but I learned how to adapt to the new normal.<sup>9</sup> 
      Despite being confined at home, I found ways to keep up with my studies.<sup>10</sup> I focused on staying connected with my friends online.<sup>11</sup> 
      The most memorable part of my teenage years was my relationship with my girlfriend.<sup>12</sup> We were schoolmates, and the memories we created together during our school days will always hold a special place in my heart.<sup>13</sup> 
      During my senior years in high school, the challenges of the pandemic seemed even more intense as we struggled with remote learning.<sup>14</sup> 
      The hardest part was working on the research paper for graduation.<sup>15</sup> It took a lot of effort, but with determination and support from my friends and teachers, I pushed through.<sup>16</sup> 
      My teenage years were full of growth, struggles, and unforgettable moments.<sup>17</sup> Each experience helped shape who I am today.<sup>18</sup> 
      I will always carry the memories of those times with me.<sup>19</sup> The bond I shared with my girlfriend and the resilience I gained during difficult times will always be important to me.<sup>20</sup></p>
