    <h2><u>Childhood Years</u></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born at Quezon City and from ages one to seven, I lived in SM Homes, North Caloocan, with my family.<sup>1</sup> It was a simple and peaceful neighborhood where I learned to play with other kids, and my parents took care of me with much love.<sup>2</sup> 
      I remember my mom always there for me, and my dad working hard to support us.<sup>3</sup> At the age of eight, things changed when we moved to our province in Ilocos Norte.<sup>4</sup> My mom went to Hong Kong as an <abbr title="Overseas Filipino Worker">OFW,</abbr>
       and my family struggled in the province.<sup>5</sup> Life was tough there, especially with strict rules and the mistreatment we experienced, which was difficult for me to understand at the time.<sup>6</sup> I often missed my mom, but we had to move forward in life.<sup>7</sup> 
       At nine years old, my mom finally came back from Hong Kong, and life started to improve.<sup>8</sup> The family reunited, and we felt a sense of relief as we are finally with each other again.<sup>9</sup> Things slowly became more stable, and I was able to enjoy a more normal childhood once again.<sup>10</sup> 
        My parents worked hard to make sure we had what we needed, and I appreciated their sacrifices.<sup>11</sup> It was a time of change and growth for me, learning how to adapt and persevere despite the challenges.<sup>12</sup> I'll always remember how resilient my parents were, and how they managed to keep our family together despite the hardships.<sup>13</sup> 
        During this time, I also discovered the importance of family.<sup>14</sup> I understood that even though life was hard, my parents always had my back.<sup>15</sup> We weren’t rich, but we had a lot of love for one another, and that made all the difference.<sup>16</sup> This chapter of my childhood shaped me into a person who valued family and hard work.<sup>17</sup>
        I'll never forget my friends who made me who I am today. They were the friends who made my childhood bearable even though there are hardships.<sup>19</sup> Looking back, 
        I’m grateful for those early years, as they taught me resilience, the importance of family, and the value of staying strong no matter what.<sup>20</sup>
