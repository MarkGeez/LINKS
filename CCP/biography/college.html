  <div><u><h2>College Years</u></h2>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I entered college, I decided to pursue an <abbr title="Bachelor of Science in Information Technology"></abbr>BSIT course because of my deep interest in computers.<sup>1</sup> I enrolled at the University of the East in Manila, and it was there that I faced new challenges, both academically and personally.<sup>2</sup> 
    College life was very different from high school, and I had to quickly adapt to the new environment.<sup>3</sup> The pressure of university studies was tough, but I kept pushing myself to do my best.<sup>4</sup> 
    I met new people and learned new things that helped expand my knowledge and skills, especially in technology, which I was so passionate about.<sup>5</sup> Some subjects were difficult, but I studied hard to overcome them.<sup>6</sup> 
    Despite facing many obstacles in college, I found ways to overcome them and keep moving forward.<sup>7</sup> I realized that time management was crucial in handling multiple assignments and exams.<sup>8</sup> 
    Balancing my studies with other aspects of life was challenging, but I learned how to stay focused.<sup>9</sup> There were times when I felt overwhelmed, but I reminded myself why I chose this path.<sup>10</sup> 
    Throughout my time at the University of the East, I also realized how important it was to surround myself with people who supported and encouraged me.<sup>11</sup> 
    Whether it was classmates, professors, or friends, their guidance played a key role in my growth during these years.<sup>12</sup> There were nights when I barely got any sleep because of deadlines and projects.<sup>13</sup> 
    Though the college journey wasn’t easy, I’m proud of how far I’ve come.<sup>14</sup> I’ve learned so much about myself and my field of study, and I feel prepared for the future ahead.<sup>15</sup> 
    There were moments when I doubted myself, but I refused to give up.<sup>16</sup> I kept reminding myself that every struggle was part of the learning process.<sup>17</sup> 
    As graduation approached, I looked back at all the hard work I had put in.<sup>18</sup> I felt a sense of accomplishment knowing that I had made it through with determination and perseverance.<sup>19</sup> 
    College taught me resilience, the value of pursuing my passions, and how to navigate life’s challenges with a positive mindset.<sup>20</sup>  </P>
